This is my first rails app. It uses [YouTube Chromeless Player](https://developers.google.com/youtube/chromeless_player_reference) to show random fullscreen youtube videos from your collection. You can switch to the next random video by pressing "space" button on keyboard. 

Users can submit link and you can approve them or not. Videos could be placed in the category, so they will be little bit less random. 

You can access admin section at the /admin Username is "putin", password "a1averda". There you can manage videos in your collection and import them from .txt file. 

Code is a real mess (first time in rails, about 2010), someday I'll clear it up, but feel free to use it! Hope it could somehow help. If I have paid for my vps, check out the [demo](http://maaaay.com/zalipay).
